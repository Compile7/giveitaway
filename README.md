# Give It Away
### Description
- #### Problem:
  There is no platform where a person can find the right place to donate things like, extra food, used items, toys, stationary etc. Person has to reach out to multiple NGO to make sure if they accept such things or not.
If we could solve the above problem this will help to achieve our first and second out of 17 sustainable goals.
- #### Solution: 
  **Give It Away** is a non profit platform which will list all the nearest NGO as per your need (books, food, used clothes, toys) , so it is easy to donate any things to needy people.

- The organizer(Giver) now wants to give his remaining extra food to those who need it. Like NGO/NPO  or any needy individual. 
- The giver has to open the "Do Not Waste" website and add basic information related to the remaining extra food and submit the request.
- This request will start appearing on the dashboard of the website and all those NGO/NPO who are nearby will get the information through notification.
- NGO will open the request and get the food details and also call and whatsapp to the giver and get the food with 🙂.
